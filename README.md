# Commodore Component: appcat

This is a [Commodore][commodore] Component for appcat.

This repository is part of Project Syn.
For documentation on Project Syn and this component, see https://syn.tools.

## Getting started for developers

This repository contains:

* `packages`: SYN Commodore "packages" (which are actually just bundles of SYN configuration files, no code)
** `composite`: SYN Configuration containing the user-facing Crossplane/K8s kind "ObjectBucket"
** `composition`: SYN Configuration containing the Crossplane "composition", which translates between the user-facing K8s kind "ObjectBucket" and Crossplane's internal K8s kinds "Bucket" and "ObjectsUser"
* `component`: SYN Commodore component for installing AppCat features

This component can be compiled with commodore like this:

```
$ cd component
$ commodore component compile . --search-paths . -n appcat -f tests/defaults.yml
#
# Alternative:
#
$ cd component
$ make test
```

The resulting compiled component can be found in `component/compiled/`.

There is currently no easy way to run it locally. You need to apply the compiled component to a test cluster to see if it works as expected.

This process is not suitable for installing the component on a production system. In order to do that please follow the documentation found in the next paragraph.
