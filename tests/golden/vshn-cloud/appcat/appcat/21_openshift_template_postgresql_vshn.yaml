    description: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database
      system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that
      safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL
      date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California
      at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.
